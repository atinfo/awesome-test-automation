## xUnit frameworks

* [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) ― The most known, extensible and portable(yes, you can run your tests on Mono for Linux and Mac) unit-testing framework in the .Net world. It comes with descent test adapters for Visual Studio 2013 - ... as well as standalone GUI and command line runners
* [MSTest (Visual Studio Test)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest) ― the most conservative and slow evolving unit testing framework with only one good thing: it is built-in to the Visual Studio. So, you can always rely it is there.
* [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) ― the "bleeding edge" unit testing framework, beloved by many developers, even from Microsoft. This is community based open source project, written by the original inventor of NUnit 2.0 
* [Gallio Icarus and MbUnit](https://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/) ― the most feature reach Test Runner, Test Reporter and Unit testing framework. It is still popular in many .NET shops, especially for running Selenium WebDriver UI tests... Unfortunately, it is not being maintained since 2012. :skull:

## TDD \ ATDD \ BDD
* [Fluent Assertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/) is a set of .NET extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style test.
``` csharp
string actual = "ABCDEFGHI";
actual.Should().StartWith("AB").And.EndWith("HI").And.Contain("EF").And.HaveLength(9);
```
* [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/) ―  A pragmatic BDD solution for .NET. It uses the Gherkin specification language and integrates to Visual Studio.
* [SpecFlow.Selenium.Plugin](https://github.com/unickq/SpecFlow.Selenium.Plugin) ― SpecFlow plugin for Selenium instances generation over tags. Cucumber for dotnet
* [BDDfy](http://docs.teststack.net/bddfy/) - The simplest BDD framework for .Net EVER! The name comes from the fact that it allows you to turn your tests into BDD behaviors simply. 

## Code analysis 

* [NCover](https://www.ncover.com/) ― really good code coverage tool, but $$
* [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) is a code coverage tool for .NET 2 and above, support for 32 and 64 processes with both branch and sequence points
* [NCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/) - an automated concurrent testing tool for Visual Studio.
* See also: [Code Coverage for C#/.NET](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/276829/code-coverage-for-c-net)

## Web UI test automation

* [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver) ― Yes! [WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is everywhere! This is the best and the most popular UI test automation library and infrastructure.

* [WatiN](http://watin.org/) ― Before the Selenium Webdriver appeared on the market, WatiN was one of the best Web UI automation frameworks for .NET.  Now it is not maintained. :skull:
* [Golem](https://github.com/ProtoTest/ProtoTest.Golem) Object Oriented C# Automated Testing Framework. Golem was created to simplify the process of creating enterprise-scale automated testing suites. It wraps around Gallio/MbUnit and a number of automation tools (such as Selenium-WebDriver) to provide the tester with a simple process for creating automated tests no matter what the tool. The inclusion of advanced features, diagnostic information, easy configuration, and enhanced API's helps Golem make automating in code-based automation tools much more practical. A standard test structure is enforced throughout the Golem framework to make the code readable and easy to reuse. Company behind it (ProtoTest) is in the process of winding down. Last commit was done in May, 2015.
* [Mailosaur](https://github.com/mailosaur/mailosaur-dotnet) - .NET client for email testing/automation via Mailosaur.
* [Ocaramba](https://github.com/ObjectivityLtd/Ocaramba) - Cross-Platform C# framework to automate tests using Selenium WebDriver.
