## xUnit frameworks

[Contribute to this section](https://github.com/atinfo/awesome-test-automation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## TDD \ ATDD \ BDD

- BDD/TDD
    * [MochaJS](http://mochajs.org/) - feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser.
    * [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) - Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, Node.js projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.
    * [Intern](https://theintern.github.io/) - is a complete test stack for JavaScript designed to help you write and run consistent, high-quality test cases for your JavaScript libraries and applications. It can be used to test any JavaScript code. Its functional testing capabilities can even be used to test non-JavaScript Web and mobile apps, if you really want.
	* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework
    * [Chakram](http://dareid.github.io/chakram/) - Chakram is a REST API testing framework offering a BDD testing style and fully exploiting promises
- BDD
    * [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) - Cucumber is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language.Cucumber.js is the JavaScript implementation of Cucumber and runs on both Node.js and modern web browsers.
- Runners
    * [Karma](http://mochajs.org/) - test runner for making TDD much easier by pre-build test environments.
    * [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/) - Wallaby.js runs your JavaScript tests immediately as you type and displays execution results in your code editor. It also provides live test execution and code coverage reports.
    * [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.

## Mock frameworks
* [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) - Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.
No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework.
* [JSMockito](http://jsmockito.org/) - JsMockito is a JavaScript stub/mock framework heavily inspired by java's Mockito.
* [apimocker](https://github.com/gstroup/apimocker) - This is a node.js module to run a simple http server, which can serve up mock service responses. Responses can be JSON or XML to simulate REST or SOAP services.

## Code analysis
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - Pluggable JavaScript linting tool. Custom rules can be added to extend the existing functionality.
* [HintJS](http://jshint.com/) - Community driving js code analysis tool supported by twitter, facebook, wiki, jquery, mozilla, yahoo and others.
* [JsLint](http://www.jslint.com/) - JavaScript syntax checker and validator.

## Web UI test automation
* [WebdriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs) - Nodejs webdriver language bindings official implementation from authors of selenium, includes only basic features and commands. Uses Control Flow to syncrhonize async actions.
* [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) - Nodejs webdriver language bindings unofficial implementation developed by SauceLabs. Has own handling of async actions using FibersJS and rich set of features
* [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) - End-to-end test framework for Angular applications, comes with JasmineWD included, and built on top of WebdriverJS
* [CodeceptJS](http://codecept.io/) - Modern era acceptance testing for NodeJS
* [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) - Easy to use Node.js based End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for browser based apps and websites.
* [Dalek.js](http://dalekjs.com/) - Automated cross browser testing with JavaScript.
* [Nemo](http://nemo.js.org/) - Nemo provides a simple way to add selenium automation to your NodeJS web projects. With a powerful configuration ability provided by krakenjs/confit, and plugin architecture, Nemo is flexible enough to handle any browser/device automation need.
* [Frisby](http://frisbyjs.com/) - Is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.
* [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) - Automated browser testing for the modern web development stack.
* [Nightmare](http://www.nightmarejs.org/) - A high-level browser automation library.
* [Gemini](https://gemini-testing.github.io) - Is an open-source utility for automating visual regression testing of web pages. Gemini takes a screenshot of elements on a page and compares it with baseline images of these elements. If the images don't match, the differences are shown in a report.
* [Hermione](https://github.com/gemini-testing/hermione#hermione) - Is the utility for integration testing of web pages using [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org).
* [Gremlins.js](https://github.com/marmelab/gremlins.js) - gremlins.js is a monkey testing library written in JavaScript, for Node.js and the browser. Use it to check the robustness of web applications by unleashing a horde of undisciplined gremlins.
* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) - Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome. Built with <3 by the Chrome team.
* [Chromeless](https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless) - Works with AWS Lambda to deploy parallel testing in a serverless setup. Compared to incumbents, API is basic for now but itâ€™s trending like a rocket now. Contributors and maintainers can shape it into a great tool.
* [Chrominator](https://github.com/jesg/chrominator) - Made by PhantomJS GhostDriver maintainer so the API is extensive. It covers many edge cases that users expect from mature headless browsers frameworks such as NightmareJS/Electron or CasperJS/PhantomJS.
* [Chromy](https://github.com/OnetapInc/chromy) - Possibly the earliest that shipped to market, releasing in early May a thoughtful set of high-level API that works with headless Chrome. Rapid improvements since then and actively explored by BackstopJS maintainer.
* [Navalia](https://github.com/joelgriffith/navalia) - Pretty refreshing approach by supporting the popular GraphQL language, which is normally meant for querying API endpoints. Looks to have a mature API set and most importantly it is well-documented.
* [Lambdium](https://github.com/smithclay/lambdium) - Deployments on AWS Lambda using Selenium WebDriver. This is a very interesting proposition, because for the existing large Selenium code base in market, it has the potential for very easy migration to this tool.
* [GhostJS](https://github.com/KevinGrandon/ghostjs) - Interesting project base on modern JavaScript that works on a multitude of browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, PhantomJS, plus expressive API. Released some time back, development seems to be picking up speed.
* [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) - CasperJS is a navigation scripting & testing utility for PhantomJS and SlimerJS (still experimental). It eases the process of defining a full navigation scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods & syntactic sugar for doing common tasks
* [Mailosaur](https://github.com/mailosaur/mailosaur-node) - Node.js client for email testing/automation via Mailosaur.

## Mobile test automation
* [WebdriverIO's Appium implementation](http://webdriver.io/api/appium/backgroundApp.html) - nodejs bindings implemeting Appium commands.
* [Macaca](https://macacajs.com/) - Solution for Automation Test with Ease. Both Mobile, Desktop Platforms Supported, native, Hybrid, Mobile Web Multi-applications Supported, Command line tools & CI Solution provided.

## Windows UI test automation
* [RobotJS](https://robotjs.io/) - The Node.js Desktop Automation Library
* [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) - SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.
