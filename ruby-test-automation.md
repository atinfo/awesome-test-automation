* [yard-doctest](https://github.com/p0deje/yard-doctest) - allows using YARD examples as tests

## TDD \ ATDD \ BDD
- TDD
    * [RR](https://github.com/rr/rr) - A test double framework that features a rich selection of double techniques and a terse syntax.
- BDD
    * [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) - Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby. RSpec becomes available in Ruby projects on attaching the rspec gem. For the Rails applications, rspec-rails gem is also required.
    * [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) - This testing tool supports BDD, and enables using features and scenarios written in a human-readable language, either English or any other language specified in the # language: comment. Cucumber becomes available in project upon installing and activating the cucumber gem.
