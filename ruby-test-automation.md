## xUnit frameworks

* [Test::Unit](http://ruby-doc.org//stdlib-2.1.5//libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html) - is intended for unit testing and comes bundled with Ruby.
* [MiniTest](https://github.com/CapnKernul/minitest-reporters#readme) - becomes available on attaching the minitest-reporters gem. The minitests are added to the Test::Unit framework.
* [yard-doctest](https://github.com/p0deje/yard-doctest) - allows to use YARD examples as tests

## TDD \ ATDD \ BDD
- TDD
    * [RR](https://github.com/rr/rr) - A test double framework that features a rich selection of double techniques and a terse syntax.
- BDD
    * [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) - Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby. RSpec becomes available in Ruby projects on attaching the rspec gem. For the Rails applications, rspec-rails gem is also required.
    * [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) - This testing tool supports BDD, and enables using features and scenarios written in a human-readable language, either English or any other language specified in the # language: comment. Cucumber becomes available in project upon installing and activating the cucumber gem.
    * [Bacon](https://github.com/chneukirchen/bacon) - A small RSpec clone.
    * [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) - minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.
    * [Spinach](https://github.com/codegram/spinach) - Spinach is a high-level BDD framework that leverages the expressive Gherkin language (used by Cucumber) to help you define executable specifications of your application or library's acceptance criteria.
- Assertions
    * [Shoulda](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) - is intended for unit testing, and becomes available in Ruby projects on attaching the shoulda gem. So doing, the Shoulda tests are added on to the Test::Unit framework.
    * [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) - Provides Test::Unit- and RSpec-compatible one-liners that test common Rails functionality. These tests would otherwise be much longer, more complex, and error-prone.
- Mocking
    * [ActiveMocker](https://github.com/zeisler/active_mocker) - Generate mocks from ActiveRecord models for unit tests that run fast because they donâ€™t need to load Rails or a database.
    * [TestXml](https://github.com/alovak/test_xml) - TestXml is a small extension for testing XML/HTML.
    * [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) - Library for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests.
    * [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) - Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.
- Extensions
    * [Cutest](https://github.com/djanowski/cutest) - Isolated tests in Ruby. Each test file is run in a forked process to avoid shared state. Once a failure is found, you get a report detailing what failed and how to locate the error and the rest of the file is skipped.
    * [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork) - A DRb server for testing frameworks (RSpec / Cucumber currently).
