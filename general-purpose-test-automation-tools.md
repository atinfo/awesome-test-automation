## Functional testing
* [gauge](http://getgauge.io) Light weight cross-platform test automation
* [STAF](http://staf.sourceforge.net/) The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source, multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of reusable components, called services (such as process invocation, resource management, logging, and monitoring). STAF removes the tedium of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling you to focus on building your automation solution. The STAF framework provides the foundation upon which to build higher level solutions, and provides a pluggable approach supported across a large variety of platforms and languages.
* [RobotFramework](http://robotframework.org/) Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).
* [Ranorex](http://www.ranorex.com/) - Ranorex is a GUI test automation framework for testing of desktop, web-based and mobile applications. Ranorex is provided by Ranorex GmbH, a software development company for innovative software test automation solutions.
* [TestComplete](https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/) - TestComplete is a functional automated testing platform developed by SmartBear Software. TestComplete gives testers the ability to create automated tests for Microsoft Windows, Web, Android (operating system), and iOS applications.
* [HP Unified Functional Testing (UFT), formerly known as (QTP)](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/unified-functional-automated-testing/index.html) - HP Unified Functional Testing is automated testing software designed for testing various software applications and environments.

## Web UI test automation
* [Ggr](https://github.com/aandryashin/ggr) - active load balancer to create scalable and highly-available Selenium cluster.
* [Selenoid](https://github.com/aandryashin/selenoid) - alternative Selenium Hub running browsers within containers.
* [RedwoodHQ](https://github.com/dmolchanenko/RedwoodHQ) - RedwoodHQ is a free Open Source test automation framework that allows multiple users to develop automation code, create readable action/keyword driven test cases and execute them all under a single Web interface.

## API testing

* [Postman REST Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-bdd) - The Postman REST client allows you to write tests for your APIs, such as ensuring that your endpoints return the proper HTTP status codes, headers, and content. It even has has a built-in test runner that makes it easy to run all of your tests and immediately see the results. And you can use the Newman command-line tool to automate your tests and integrate them into your CI and deployment pipeline.
* [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/) - SoapUI is an open-source web service testing application for service-oriented architectures (SOA) and REST. Its functionality covers web service inspection, invoking, development, simulation and mocking, functional testing, load and compliance testing.
* [Rapise](https://www.inflectra.com/Rapise/) - Rapise is GUI based tool. Rapise's unique Learn and Go testing method is much more time efficient than traditional record-and-playback processes. 
* [Restlet Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm) - Restlet Client (formerly known as DHC) allows you to interact with REST services. It brings many different features that make your user experience better, save you precious time when debugging HTTP calls or sharing your requests with others.
* [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com) - Beeceptor is an HTTP proxy for intercepting and mocking API calls selectively. E.g. assume api 'A' has a downstream api 'B', how do simulate B's responses for validating 'A'. Beeceptor also helps in performance testing 'A' by mocking all calls of 'B' and not impacting downstream services.
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Swagger is the open-source framework of API developer tools for the OpenAPI Specification(OAS), enabling development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment. 

## Performance and load testing
* [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6) - Like unit testing, for performance. A modern load testing tool, using Go and JavaScript.
* [LoadComplete](https://smartbear.com/product/loadcomplete/overview/) - LoadComplete is a desktop tool for load, stress, scalability testing of websites and web applications. Designed from the ground-up to help you focus on the tasks at hand, it does not require advanced programming skills. It works with both traditional HTML web sites and with Rich Internet Applications using modern web technologies like AJAX, ASP.NET, Java, Flash, Flex and Silverlight. The licensing policy is based on the number of virtual users required for the load testing.

## Security testing

* [OWASP Glue](https://github.com/OWASP/glue) - Glue is a framework for running a series of tools. Generally, it is intended as a backbone for automating a security analysis pipeline of tools.

## Test design

* [PICT (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict) - PICT generates test cases and test configurations. With PICT, you can generate tests that are more effective than manually generated tests and in a fraction of the time required by hands-on test case design.
