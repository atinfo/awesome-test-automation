## xUnit frameworks

* [JUnit](http://junit.org/) - Common testing framework.
* [TestNG](http://testng.org/) - TestNG - Testing framework.

## TDD \ ATDD \ BDD

- tools
    * [JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) - A framework for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.
    * [Cucumber-JVM](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm) - A pure Java implementation of Cucumber that supports the most popular programming languages for the JVM.
    * [easyb](http://easyb.org/) - A behavior driven development framework for the Java platform. By using a specification based Domain Specific Language, easyb aims to enable executable, yet readable documentation.
    * [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) - A generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).
- extensions
    * [cucumber-report-db](https://github.com/porscheinformatik/cucumber-report-db) - Stores results of BDD tests with Cucumber-JVM in a database and provides reporting capabilities.

## Model-Based Testing

- [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.org/) - A framework for Model-Based Testing. The tool reads models i various formats like graphml, dot or json, and then generate tests from the models.

## Code analysis 

* [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) - Open source project to manage code quality.

## Web UI test automation

- libraries

    * [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) - SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.
- frameworks and wrappers
    * [Selenide](http://selenide.org/) - Concise API around Selenium to write stable and readable UI tests.
    * [Thucydides](http://www.thucydides.info/) - An innovative open source library that helps you write more effective automated acceptance tests, and uses these acceptance tests to generates rich documentation and reports about your product and project.
- extensions
    *  

## Mobile test automation

* [Appium](http://appium.io/) - An open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It drives iOS and Android apps using the WebDriver protocol.
* [Calabash](http://calaba.sh/) - A cross-platform test automation framework for Android and iOS native and hybrid applications. Calabashâ€™s easy-to-understand syntax enables even non-technical people to create and execute automated acceptance tests for apps on both of these mobile platforms.
* [Robotium](https://code.google.com/p/robotium/) - An Android test automation framework that fully supports native and hybrid applications. Robotium makes it easy to write powerful and robust automatic black-box UI tests for Android applications. With the support of Robotium, test case developers can write function, system and user acceptance test scenarios, spanning multiple Android activities.
* [UIautomator](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/uiautomator/index.html) - Provides an efficient way to test UIs. It creates automated functional test cases that can be executed against apps on real Android devices and emulators. It includes a viewer, which is a GUI tool to scan and analyze the UI components of an Android app.
* [Espresso](https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/wiki/Espresso) - A pretty new test automation framework that got open-sourced just last year, making it available for developers and testers to hammer out their UIs. Espresso has an API that is small, predictable, easy to learn and built on top of the Android instrumentation framework. You can quickly write concise and reliable Android UI tests with it.

## Windows UI test automation 

* [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) - SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.

## Unix \ Linux UI test automation 

* [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) - SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.

## MacOS UI test automation 

* [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) - SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components. This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or the source code of the application or web page you want to act on.

## Virtual environments

## Build Tools

* [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) - Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

With its editors, code analyzers, and converters, you can quickly and smoothly upgrade your applications to use new Java 8 language constructs, such as lambdas, functional operations, and method references.

## ORM frameworks and libraries

* [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/) - Hibernate ORM enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process. As an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, Hibernate is concerned with data persistence as it applies to relational databases (via JDBC).
* [Morphia](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia) - Morphia is a lightweight type-safe library for mapping Java objects to/from MongoDB. Morphia provides a typesafe, and fluent Query API support with (runtime) validation. Morphia uses annotations so there are no XML files to manage or update. Morphia should feel very comfortable for any developer with JPA experience.

## Useful libs

* [AspectJ](https://eclipse.org/aspectj/) - Seamless aspect-oriented extension to the Java. AspectJ enables clean modularization of crosscutting concerns, such as error checking and handling, synchronization, context-sensitive behavior, performance optimizations, monitoring and logging, debugging support, and multi-object protocols.
